NPWD Redesign
</h1>


This is a simple redesign for my server’s NPWD, inspired by iPhone. The redesign features a power button and an iPhone-style bottom bar for quickly returning to the main menu. I also removed the frames option from the settings. For more information about NPWD, visit [the official NPWD repository](https://github.com/project-error/npwd).

**Note**: This redesign is provided as-is, and I do not offer support for troubleshooting errors.

## Installation

1. **Quick Install**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder into your `npwd` folder.
2. **Custom Build**: If you’d like to customize further, build your own UI based on this design using provided source code.
